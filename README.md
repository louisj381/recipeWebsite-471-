# Project Cake
School Project to understand database complexity, specifically managing relationships and providing data in a meaningful way

## A Food Website
This project was centered around food. Users could create Meal Plans, organize their recipes, and even specify alergies- the goal being to  make a user friendly but comprehensive food manager.

## General Organization
* Users could be standard or curators
* Curators could create channels that regular users could subscribe too
* Users can create meal plans, which contain meals
* Meals contain recipes, which include attributes like name, instructions, and prep/cook time
* Could also store ingredients, and optionally store substitues
* Users can log their alergies, and the system would automatically suggest substitutes for an ingredient
